# catkin_ws_remote

## Windows Remote controller for Two axis Adaptable Ankle (TADA) prosthetic device

## Dependecies
This repo acts as additive functionality to the tadaros package:
https://github.com/kieran-nichols/catkin_ws_tadaros.git

## Motor node
1) If the motor node continuously crashes, 
* Check to see if the batteries for the motor and motor drivers are above 12V. 
* Then physically check to see if a wire is dislodged, then connect to Elmo to see if the motor moves. 
* If not, try "Quick Tune" or "Expert Tune" to deduce the error (usually hall sensor wire dislodged). Sometimes running the motors through Elmo, helps reset the motors and the weird resetting issues disappears.
